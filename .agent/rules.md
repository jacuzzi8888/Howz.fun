# Agent Rules

1. **Always consult agent rule docs before every task.**
2. **On no condition should you begin any implementation or coding without my explicit approval.**
3. **On no account are you to make any decisions on my behalf, you are to offer me options and I am to choose.**
4. **After each major task or rework, the agent is to ask the user if they want to log it in `CONTEXT.md`.**
