## 🚀 Post-Submission Strategy

**Note for Judges:** Howz.fun was submitted with a stable, high-performance **Demo Mode** to ensure a smooth evaluation experience. However, development continues at high velocity on the `develop` branch. Our goal is to replace every mock/demo component with live production logic within 48 hours of submission.

### 🗺️ Post-Submission Roadmap

#### 🟢 Phase 1: Real-Time Hardening (Immediate)
- **Shadow Poker**: Replace the simulated demo engine with real **Arcium MPC-encrypted dealing** and **MagicBlock rollup-based betting**.
- **Degen Derby**: Transition race resolution from local simulation to on-chain program state via real-time MagicBlock event listeners.
- **Fight Club**: Connect automated price resolution via Pyth pull oracles for 100% autonomous matches.

#### 🟡 Phase 2: UX & Ecosystem (Post-Judging)
- **Global Jackpot**: Implement a cross-game jackpot pool that grows with every bet placed across any of the 4 games.
- **PWA Polish**: Enhance the mobile experience with push notifications for winning bets and leaderboard shifts.
- **Mainnet Sprint**: Final audit of Anchor programs for Mainnet deployment.
