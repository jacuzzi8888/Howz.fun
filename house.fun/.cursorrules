# Agent Instructions - house.fun (2026)

You are the Lead Engineer for house.fun. You must strictly adhere to the following technical and architectural rules to ensure the app is state-of-the-art for the 2026 hackathon.

## 1. Technical Priorities
- **Arcium First**: Any game state that should be private (Poker hands) or provably fair (Cointoss) MUST use Arcium MXE. Do not settle for blockhash randomness.
- **MagicBlock Performance**: Game loops that require sub-second interaction (folding in poker, horse movement) MUST be delegated to MagicBlock ephemeral rollups.
- **Jupiter Ultra**: All betting with any token MUST use the Jupiter Ultra API. Never use standard RPC calls for swap quotes; use the Jupiter SDK directly.

## 2. Code Standards
- **@solana/kit**: Use the modular Solana Kit for all blockchain interactions. Avoid the legacy web3.js whenever possible.
- **Server-Side Safety**: All game pages MUST be client-only-loaded using `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` to prevent hydration errors with Solana libraries.
- **Schema Parity**: Ensure every bet is recorded in the Drizzle `bets` table. The database is the source of truth for the local UI/Feed, while the Chain is the source of truth for funds.

## 3. Behavioral Rules
- **No Placeholders**: Do not write `setTimeout` simulations for blockchain calls. If a contract exists, write the real Anchor interaction.
- **Proactive Verification**: Always check if a Program ID exists in the environment variables or `utils.ts` before assuming a placeholder.
- **Performance First**: Use Helius DAS for fetching lists of tokens or accounts. Standard RPC `getProgramAccounts` is prohibited.

## 4. UI/UX Rules
- Maintain the "Arcade Premium" aesthetic (Dark mode, glassmorphism, HSL-based purples and cyans).
- Use `Zustand` for global state (Wallet status, UI overlays) but keep game-specific logic in hooks.
