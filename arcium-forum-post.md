**Title: Requesting Mainnet Access for Casino Gaming Project**

Hi Arcium team!

I'm building **house.fun** - a privacy-preserving casino platform on Solana.

**What we're building:**
- Multi-game casino (Flip It, Degen Derby, Shadow Poker, Memecoin Fight Club)
- Using Arcium for provably fair randomness via MPC
- Targeting mainnet deployment for production use

**Current status:**
- Smart contract with Arcium proof verification built (Rust/Anchor)
- Frontend integration complete with Arcium SDK
- Mock mode working for development

**What we need:**
Since Arcium is now on mainnet (congrats on the launch!), how do we get API credentials/access for production deployment? Is there a developer onboarding process?

**Tech stack:**
- Solana / Anchor
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- Arcium SDK for MPC-based randomness

**Target:** Production-ready with real Arcium mainnet integration

Would love guidance on getting mainnet access. Happy to share more technical details!

Thanks,
[Your name/handle]
